# AWS-Powershell-Custom-Alarms

I created 2 custom alarms.

One to check to see if a webpage loads (check_webpage.ps1) and a second to test if the mysql connection is up (check_mysql.ps1)

This is a webpage load wrapper function to check if we can load a webpage successfully and report to AWS Cloudwatch
